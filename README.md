## Working Prototype

You can find a working prototype of the site here: https://mersenne1729.github.io/new-quiz

## Functionality

The site's functionality includes:

* A simple one-page site that starts the quiz after the user clicks on the start button.
* The users’ inputs are checked using JavaScript arrays with a results page at the end of the quiz.
* The quiz will refresh once the start again button is clicked.

## Technical

The site is built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery. It has been built to be fully responsive across mobile, tablet and desktop screen resolutions.
